# Giphy-API
This assignment was inspired by my love of random movies. But not all the movies on here are my favorite, because my favorite movies don't all have gifs. 

There were some difficulties getting the text from buttons, as val() wouldn't work. Plus getting more than one gif to show up as well proved to be a hassle, as well as figuring out why the gifs weren't showing up. 

The gifs were playing during the last push, but after some tweaking they stopped working and I didn't push. So hopefully they still work.
